			 		<p>Fire safety education and training is not only required by law, it’s also an extremely important skill to obtain regarding the safety of employees and others who might be in the building. Fires are damaging to property, cause injury or death, and can even eliminate jobs since many buildings destroyed by fire are not rebuilt. The way to prevent these dire outcomes is proper fire safety training.</p>
			 		<br>
			 		<p>Taking part in fire safety training will provide workers with skills such as recognizing hazards, being able to complete a fire risk assessment, taking action in preventing fires, and lastly understanding how to respond in the case of an emergency. All of these are indispensable skills and give employees the potential to completely eliminate fire risks in the workplace</p>
			 		<br>
			 		<p>Learning about fire hazards is the key to preventing fire from occurring. Teaching a workforce about the combustion triangle is a good place to start. The triangle consists of the necessary ingredients that fires spark from: heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent. Once these basics are learned, then hazards are more visible in the workplace since the employees know what to look for.</p>

			 		<br>
			 		<br>
			 		<p>Learning how to respond to a fire is a large part of fire safety training and is essential in creating a clear understanding of protocol in emergency situations so employees will be sufficiently prepared to fight the fire or get out safely and efficiently. Fire training courses teach how to use firefighting equipment like fire extinguishers, how to activate the fire alarm, and how to work as a team, as well as learning what one’s own responsibilities are. However, these are only a few subjects that are covered in emergency response training.</p>
			 		<br>
			 		<p>Promoting a culture whereby employees understand the importance of fire safety in the workplace will help you to prepare for an emergency. This will also encourage employees to voice when they suspect a potential risk, allowing you to take preventative action. Fires can occur at any time but most can be prevented. Find out how Banner Fire can help you plan for and prevent a fire below. Overall, participating in fire safety training does wonders to help prevent fires just from the workers being more aware of their surroundings and knowing what can ignite a fire.</p>

					<h2 id="topic">Fire Safety Order 2005</h2>
					<br>
					<p>In accordance with the Fire Safety Order 2005, a 'responsible person' must carry out, or appoint a 'competent person' to carry out suitable and sufficient risk assessments of the fire safety in commercial or domestic premises in order to protect others from the risks of a potential fire.
					As most fires are preventable, those responsible for buildings and premises should take responsibility for and adopt the right behaviours and procedures.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Fire safety is important in all premises, whether it be an office, hotel, house, apartment or a warehouse. It’s critical to identify fire hazards, the people at risk, reduce the risk from occurring and inform others how they can play their part in ensuring the safety of a workplace, domestic property or a public place. There are fire safety regulations for commercial landlords, so if you’re renting out a property to tenants, you will first need to make sure that it is agreed who will be taking care of the building fire safety, as it may be better for a professional to meet the fire safety requirements for commercial buildings.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Fire hazards increase the likelihood of a fire breaking out or impeding the escape in the event of a fire outbreak occurring. This is why fire safety is a critical component of general health and safety. A fire hazard may include a situation that increases the likelihood of a fire or may impede escape in the event a fire occurs. Fire safety is often a component of building safety.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h2 id="topic">Fire Safety Procedures</h2>
					<br>
					<p>In order to complete regular checks and ensure that a building is as safe as it can be in preventing or reducing the impact of a fire, there are several fire safety procedures that must be carried out in accordance with legislation. These fire safety solutions:</p>
					<p>
						<ul class="text-warning" id="list">
							<li>PAT Testing</li>
							<li>Fire Extinguisher Installation & Servicing</li>
							<li>Fire Sprinklers Installation & Servicing</li>
							<li>Fire Alarm Installation & Maintenance</li>
							<li>Dry Riser Installation & Testing</li>
							<li>Emergency Lighting Installation & Maintenance</li>
							<li>Fire Risk Assessments</li>
							<li>Fire Safety Sign Installation</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>Fire safety responsibilities will often include carrying out fire safety risk assessments (which are regularly reviewed to ensure maximum safety), identifying and reporting any fire safety risks, putting in place appropriate fire safety measures, planning for an emergency and providing others with fire safety training and instructions where needed.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h2 id="topic">Who Is Responsible for Fire Safety?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>If you’re an employer, owner of premises, landlord or occupier, you will become responsible for the fire safety of a property. You are also responsible if you’re in control of the premises, for example, if you are a building manager, risk assessor or managing agent. For organisations employing five or more people or licensed premises, a fire risk assessment must be completed with the actions recorded. Following this assessment, appropriate fire safety measures must be implemented with the assessment up to date.</p>
					<br>
					<p>A fire risk assessor or competent person carrying out fire risk assessments aren’t required to have academic qualifications, however, they must understand relevant fire safety legislation, the principles of fire safety, fire hazards, fire risks, and also have appropriate training and experience to understand how to effectively deliver fire safety assessments properly.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h2 id="topic">Penalties for Failing to Adhere to Fire Safety</h2>
					<br>
					<p>You could be fined or go to prison if you don’t follow fire safety regulations. Local authorities have the right to inspect premises and issue any urgent notices relating to fire safety, so it’s important that you regularly keep on top of your fire safety. Whether you require business fire safety or domestic fire safety, you can relax knowing that we will take care of everything, with our complete range of fire protection services to industry and commerce.
